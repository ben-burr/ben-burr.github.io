# statistical-learning
Hello to the one or two people who will ever view this page. My name is Ben. I am an industry statistician who works with data mining tools, enjoys experimental designs and models, and never much got the hang of probability theory (yet). This page will document my journey over the next two years as I fill in background and develop skills I find interesting or useful. I would end this with "Enjoy!" but if you ended up here you probably did some kind of creative websearch to find help with a homework question. So "good luck!" instead.

I also just learned how to git commit from my computer thanks to Jenny Bryan and Jim Hester. This was a real, live, shell commit.
